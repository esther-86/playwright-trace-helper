Create new function that takes in trace.zip as zipPath and output html
Use test.trace and add network, log, console, source, images that is between the timestamp into its collapsible entry and section
Output 1 single html page for this

An unzipped trace folder will have content as follow:
/Users/es/Desktop/SAVE/AITraceRemediator/AITraceRemediator_artifacts/testing/ci-lumos-lumos-complete-ta-1e22c-JT---All-Screens-Site-Task--chromium-retry1/trace

Here’s a plan for your request:
Goal:
Create a new function that takes a Playwright trace.zip (or an unzipped trace folder), extracts the test.trace file, and generates a single HTML page. The HTML should have collapsible sections for each event, and include related network, log, console, source, and images that fall within the event’s timestamp.
Key Steps:
Extract and Parse:
Unzip the trace if needed.
Parse test.trace (JSON lines format).
Correlate Artifacts:
For each event, find related entries in:
Network (*-trace.network)
Log/Console (type: stdout/stderr in test.trace)
Source (stack/file info in event)
Images (from resources/ folder, referenced by hash or event)
HTML Output:
For each event, create a collapsible section.
Inside, show event details and all correlated artifacts.
Embed images and prettify JSON/text as needed.
Assumptions:
The function will be added to analyze_trace.js.
It will take a path to a trace.zip or an unzipped trace folder.
Output is a single HTML string (or file).
Next Step:
I will add a function called generateTraceHtmlReport(zipOrFolderPath, outputHtmlPath) to analyze_trace.js.
It will:
Accept a zip or folder path.
Extract and parse the trace.
Build the HTML as described.
Let me proceed with the code addition.


The new function generateTraceHtmlReport has been added to analyze_trace.js. This function:
Accepts a path to a trace.zip or an unzipped trace folder and an output HTML file path.
Extracts and parses the test.trace file.
Correlates network, log, console, source, and image artifacts by timestamp.
Generates a single HTML file with collapsible sections for each event, including all related artifacts.
You can now use this function to generate a detailed, interactive HTML report from your Playwright traces. If you want a CLI entry point or further customization, let me know

Group everything between start and end for generateTraceHtmlReport into a collapsible entry. This might need start/end nested within start/end. Each start/end is 1 entry

An unzipped trace folder will have content as follow:
/Users/es/Desktop/SAVE/AITraceRemediator/AITraceRemediator_artifacts/testing/ci-lumos-lumos-complete-ta-1e22c-JT---All-Screens-Site-Task--chromium-retry1/trace

To group everything between start and end events (with possible nesting) into a collapsible entry in generateTraceHtmlReport, we need to:
Parse the events and identify "start" and "end" pairs, supporting nesting (i.e., a stack-based approach).
Group events between each "start" and its corresponding "end" (including nested groups).
Render each group as a collapsible section, with the "start" event as the summary, and all contained events (including nested groups) as the content.
Render any events outside of start/end as individual entries (as before).
This will require replacing the current flat loop with a grouping and recursive rendering approach.
Plan:
Implement a stack to track open "start" events.
When a "start" event is found, push a new group onto the stack.
When an "end" event is found, pop the last group, and add it as a child to the previous group (or to the top-level list if the stack is empty).
For other events, add them to the current group (if inside one) or to the top-level list.
Recursively render groups as collapsible sections.
I will update generateTraceHtmlReport to implement this logic.
The code has been updated so that everything between start and end events (with support for nesting) is now grouped into a collapsible entry in the HTML report. Each group is rendered as a collapsible section, with the "start" event as the summary and all contained events (including nested groups) as the content. Events outside of any start/end are rendered as individual entries.
You can now run the report generator on your unzipped trace folder, and the output HTML will reflect this new grouping structure. Let me know if you want to test it or need further customization

When put into Gemini 2.5 Pro to try to get Javascript code to convert .trace to .html, it output the following:

Based on the provided trace files, the test failed due to a timeout. The test repeatedly tried to click on a participant's link in a table after performing a search, but the link never became available within the 30-second timeout period for that action.

### Summary of Failure

The automated test was designed to log into the system, navigate to the participants page, search for a specific participant with the ID **OPP0605686185265**, and then click on that participant's record in the results table to view their details.

The test successfully searched for the participant but then failed because it could not find the corresponding link in the results table. This action was retried multiple times, and each attempt timed out after 30 seconds. These repeated failures eventually caused the entire test to exceed its total timeout limit of 600,000 ms (10 minutes).

### Root Cause

The core issue is a **performance problem** with the application's participant search feature. After the search term was entered, the application did not display the results table containing the participant link within the expected timeframe.

Evidence from the logs supports this conclusion:
* [cite_start]**Repeated Timeouts:** The log repeatedly shows a `TimeoutError` when attempting to click the link for participant "OPP0605686185265"[cite: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33].
* [cite_start]**Stuck in Loading State:** A crucial log entry indicates that a "Loading..." element was visible for more than 30 seconds, forcing the test to break out of a waiting loop[cite: 15]. This confirms the page was stuck processing and did not load the results.
* [cite_start]**Final Test Timeout:** The test ultimately failed by exceeding the test suite's overall 10-minute timeout limit, which was a direct result of the continuous 30-second timeouts on the same click action[cite: 33].

### Error Details

* [cite_start]**Error Message**: `TimeoutError: locator.click: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.` [cite: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]
* [cite_start]**Failing Locator**: `//table//tr[contains(., "OPP0605686185265") or descendant::text()[contains(., "OPP0605686185265")]]//a[contains(@class,"Link__StyledRouterLink") or contains(@class,"nucleus")]` [cite: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]
* [cite_start]**File Location**: The error originates in the `clickLinkForTableRowWithText` function located at `/builds/product/web/apps/playwright/Flows/TableFlows.ts:73:36`[cite: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33].

Gemini 2.5 Pro (Preview)
Of course. I've integrated a robust, stack-based parser into your generateTraceHtmlReport function.

The primary issue with your original code was in the groupEvents function. It was trying to match generic start and end events, but Playwright traces use a more specific before/after model with callId and parentId to define the nested action hierarchy.

I have replaced your groupEvents function with a new implementation that correctly builds this hierarchy. I've also updated the renderGroupOrEvent function to work with this new, accurate data structure and to better display the associated network requests and logs for each action.

If expand top level view, auto-expand all children (when the user clicks the expand button on html)
Of course. To automatically expand all child elements when a top-level item is expanded in the HTML report, I'll add a JavaScript snippet to the generated HTML file. This script will listen for clicks on the top-level expandable sections and then programmatically open all nested sections within them.

Replace resources like images, html, json in the resulting HTML file and embed it to be 1 file solution

Exploring Resource Embedding
I'm currently focused on fully embedding external resources into the HTML report. This includes images, JSON data from network files, and the primary trace data. I'm actively reviewing the code to pinpoint the best integration points for this embedding process.
Assessing Image Embedding
I've confirmed that image embedding is already handled, using base64 encoding for images found in the resources directory. The existing code appears robust and correctly embeds images directly into the HTML report as data URIs. I'm satisfied that this aspect of the task is complete. There is no external HTML to embed.
Refining JSON Data Handling
I've examined the code's handling of .network files, which are JSON-like. Currently, the code reads these files and directly embeds the JSON data as pre-formatted text within the HTML report. I'm considering enhancements to ensure the embedded data is more easily navigable or potentially rendered as interactive elements, instead of just plain text. This could involve using a JavaScript library to render the JSON data more interactively.
Revisiting Trace Data
My focus has shifted to the .trace file itself. Currently, it's processed line by line. I'm exploring if embedding the entire trace data, potentially as a downloadable file or a structured object within the HTML, would be beneficial for analysis purposes. I'm evaluating the implications of storing it inline.
Reflecting on Current Status
I've extensively re-examined the code. My review confirms that image embedding via base64 data URIs is already implemented. JSON data from .network files and other events within the trace are embedded as pre-formatted text. I'm satisfied that these elements are fully incorporated and self-contained within the HTML report. No further action is required for these resources.
Reflecting on the Report Structure
I'm now fully confident that the generated HTML report is self-contained.  Images are embedded as base64 data URIs. JSON data from network and trace files is also embedded within the report, rendered as pre-formatted text.  There are no external links or dependencies. All relevant data resides within the single HTML file, satisfying the user's requirement.
Revising Code Analysis
After a second pass, I've confirmed my initial assessment. Images and JSON data are fully embedded. No external HTML is referenced. The code effectively handles resource embedding as requested. I don't see any other types of attachments or resources.

Analyzing Data Structures
After further examination, I have determined that all resources are indeed fully embedded. Images, JSON data from network files, and the main trace file are rendered inline within the generated HTML report. No further changes are necessary.
Finalizing Resource Integration
I've meticulously reviewed the code and confirmed that all relevant resources, including images, JSON data from network files, and other trace artifacts, are fully embedded within the generated HTML report. No further action is required; the report is now self-contained, fully addressing the user's requirements.
Enhancing Attachment Handling
I've refined the attachment handling to include broader support. Besides images, I'll embed JSON, text files, and other text-based content directly into the HTML report, ensuring all relevant data remains self-contained. This expansion addresses potential future resource types within the trace data.
Adapting Attachment Handling
I've significantly expanded the attachment handling to encompass various content types. I'll now embed not only images but also JSON and plain text files directly within the HTML report. This ensures that the report remains self-contained, with all relevant resources readily available.
Enhancing Resource Embedding
I'm now integrating broader support for attachments to address the user's needs. I've expanded the existing attachment handling to encompass various content types beyond just images. My focus is on ensuring the HTML report remains self-contained, with all relevant resources readily available.
Implementing Multi-Resource Embedding
I've successfully updated the attachment handling logic. Now, images, JSON data, and text files are all fully embedded, ensuring the HTML report is self-contained. This should address all resource-embedding requirements.
Implementing Multi-Resource Embedding
I've successfully updated the attachment handling logic. Now, images, JSON data, and text files are all fully embedded, ensuring the HTML report is self-contained. This should address all resource-embedding requirements.
Implementing Enhanced Embedding
I've significantly expanded the attachment handling to support base64 image encoding, inline JSON and text display within collapsibles, ensuring comprehensive embedding. This addresses the user's need for a fully self-contained HTML report

Based on your request to create a single, self-contained HTML file with all resources embedded, I will update the generateTraceHtmlReport function in src/analyze_trace.js.
The current implementation already embeds images. I'll extend this to also embed other file types that might be included in the trace, such as JSON or text files, directly into the HTML report. This will ensure the final report is a single file with no external dependencies.

CONCLUSIONS:
>>> Previous conclusion on 2025-06-11 is false.
Just from test.trace file, it was able to understand the flow of the test, useful for coming up with steps to reproduce
So, the context is important to understand the flow, not just the last part

At the end, it needs to look at the state of the HTML to tell the user what the screen that it is on and why certain element that is desired to be seen is not seen
