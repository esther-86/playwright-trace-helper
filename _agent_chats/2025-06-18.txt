Based on the trace information provided, here's the UI flow that was executed:

1. **Initialization**
   - A new browser page was created (`browserContext.newPage`)

2. **Navigation to Login Page**
   - Navigated to `https://--test.-.com` (`page.goto`)
   - Waited for various loading states and elements:
     - `body:not(:empty)`
     - Loading spinners and indicators
     - - logo animation

3. **Login Process**
   - Located and clicked the email input field
   - Filled in email: `-@gmail.com`
   - Pressed Tab key to move to next field
   - Located and clicked "Continue" button
   - Located and clicked the password input field
   - Filled in password: `AutoTest_123`
   - Pressed Tab key
   - Clicked "Sign in" button

4. **Post-Login Loading**
   - Multiple checks for loading states
   - Waited for various UI elements to become visible
   - Made API call to fetch site training config

5. **Navigation to Participants Page**
   - Navigated to `https://--test.-.com/site/study/1817/participants`
   - Waited for loading states

6. **Language Selection**
   - Clicked language selector
   - Selected "English"
   - Confirmed language selection

7. **Participant Search**
   - Located and clicked search input field
   - Cleared search field
   - Typed search term: `OPP0605686185265`
   - Attempted to click on the search result matching this ID
     - This operation failed multiple times with timeout errors (30s timeout)
     - The search-retry cycle repeated 8 times without success

8. **Final State**
   - The trace ends with the system still attempting the participant search operation

**Key Observations:**
- The flow successfully completed authentication
- The main failure point was in locating/clicking the participant search result
- Each search attempt followed the same pattern:
  1. Click search field
  2. Clear field
  3. Type search term
  4. Attempt to click result (fails after 30s)
- The UI appeared to be loading between attempts (multiple checks for loading spinners and elements)

The trace suggests the test failed because it couldn't successfully select the participant record after searching, despite multiple retries.
